### Description

We have currently uploaded 100 sample cases of data with different people and different motions. We will be uploading all the data (2K+) soon. The file structure is as follows:

- 8fuu431r1yviisw4.zip (Random filename)
  - full_on (Full on light)
    - 00000.jpg ([Camera index].jpg)
    - ...
    - 00031.jpg 
  - pos (Positive gradient light)
  - neg (Negative gradient light)
  - mask (Mask)
  - normal_alpha (Estimated normal with alpha mask channel)
  - transforms.json (The JSON file for NeRF)
- 8fuu431r2rlnjhv6.zip
- ...



*The normal maps are calculated within UltraStageâ€™s world coordinate system, which is consistent with the camera and lighting systems. Here is the reference coordinate system of world space normal maps. For more coordinate system detail, please see our Supplementary Materials.*
